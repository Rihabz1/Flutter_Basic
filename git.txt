🚀 Git Command Guide for Beginners

🔰 Initial Setup

1. Initialize a new Git repository
git init
- Creates a .git folder in your project.
- Starts tracking your project with Git.

2. Add files to staging area
git add .
- Adds all new/modified files to the staging area.
- '.' means "current directory and everything inside it".

3. Commit the staged files
git commit -m "Your message"
- Saves a snapshot of staged files.
- -m adds a commit message describing the changes.

4. Rename branch to main
git branch -M main
- Renames your branch to main (standard name instead of master).

5. Connect to GitHub (Remote Repository)
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
- Links your local repo to a remote GitHub repo.
- 'origin' is the nickname for the remote.

6. Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
- Uploads code to GitHub.
- -u sets upstream so next time you can just run git push.

📦 To update GitHub after changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update message"
git push

🔎 Useful Commands

Check status of files
git status
- See which files are changed, staged, or untracked.

🌿 Git Branching

Create a new branch
git branch branch_name

Switch to that branch
git switch branch_name

Push that branch to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin branch_name

List all local branches
git branch

🔁 Syncing with Remote Repository

Fetch changes from remote
git fetch
- Gets changes from GitHub but doesn’t merge them.

Pull and merge changes
git pull
- git pull = git fetch + git merge
- Automatically updates your branch with remote changes.

To pull unrelated histories
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

🔀 Merging Branches

Merge another branch into main
git switch main
git merge branch_name

🗑️ Delete Branches

Locally
git branch -d branch_name

On GitHub
git push origin --delete branch_name

⏪ Rollback / Undo

Revert to a specific commit
git revert <commit_hash>
- Safely creates a new commit that undoes a specific commit.
